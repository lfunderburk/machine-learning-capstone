Title: "Predicting Fuel Efficiency with Python: A Machine Learning Approach"

Abstract:

In this talk, we will explore how to use Python and machine learning techniques to study fuel consumption and predict the fuel efficiency of vehicles. We will start by discussing the challenges and limitations of using traditional methods to study fuel consumption, and how machine learning can provide more accurate and scalable solutions. We will then walk through a sample Python script that uses the EPA's Fuel Economy data website to extract and clean data, select features, train a machine learning model, and evaluate its performance. Finally, we will discuss some of the potential applications and benefits of using machine learning to study fuel consumption, and provide some resources for those interested in learning more.
